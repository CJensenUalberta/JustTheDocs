Welcome to Charles' Documentation Repository! Here is where I will be collecting the documentation of various work I am doing in the ultrafast spectroscopy laboratory.

I am still new to the documentation side of GitHub and will develope this as I go along. Hopefully this will serve as a useful Wiki in the future that other students can use.
